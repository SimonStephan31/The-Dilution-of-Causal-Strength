CUfjMoj7eL5W	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	3	7	I assumed that since the cause entity had a specific amount of energy and it was emitted all at once that the energy declines the further it radiates. Leaving low energy at the bottom right since it's far away from the causal entity.	29	1: male	NO issues.
RFnk8riAbyPE	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	The effects should be equal in the two cases.	69	1: male	NA

qJ9GnC1AP2n4	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	4	6	B only had one e while a had four so that to me would mean that the e on b would have more energy 	29	2: female	NA
pyNWWAVZLdaN	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	4	8	I thought in Situation A that energy would be somewhat equally distributed to all four entities whereas the bottom right entity would be able to have more influence in the absence of the other 3 entities. 	19	2: female	NA

In study B the power was only shared between 1"	59	2: female	NA
JzVxFnrKVKAC	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	3	9	In situation A, there were 4 E's so therefore it is more likely the energy will be spread across all 4 of them compared to situation B where there is just the 1 E where all the energy will be emitted around. 	20	2: female	none
2fDsmagufdiJ	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	No indication for why the relationship and the states would differ between the two.	31	1: male	NA
H6kd0ugAZPHZ	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	9	9	As the cause has an infinite amount of energy then surely it makes no difference to the situation regarding how many entities it feeds 	59	1: male	NA
v1Z8TBe8jfb6	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	6	3	While radially the bottom-right effects were in the same position in the plane, in Situation A the cause had three other equally-weighted effects coming from different areas of the plane.	25	1: male	NA
i6osTHYv6jQJ	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	5	10	I thought that the effects of cause on all entities in senario a would be equal as the cause it distributing its energy between teh four entitys.As there is only one entity in teh secons senario i determined that the infulence would be very high as the cause was focusing all its effort on just one entity.	32	1: male	I found that there were no errors with this study.
3xnZYRVqd0Q3	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	"As I don't know what effect, if any, the causal entity ""C"" creates, nor do I know how the entities ""E"" react to any effects (if they react at all), nor do I know the starting conditions, I can't make any sensible predictions about the system.  If, for example, I knew that ""C"" provided energy and whether and how ""E"" responds to energy, as well as its initial state, I could draw conclusions.  Even not knowing if the energy was sufficient to cause changes, I could make a guess.  But with this little information about the system it is impossible for me to even begin to figure out what can, did, or would happen.  So answering 50% was the only thing I could do that felt sensible at all."	44	1: male	NA
pvwO4awjKnj2	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	4	10	In the first situation, only one entity was present therefore all the energy would be directed to that entity from the cause C. In the second situation, all entities were present therefore the energy would be shared between entities.	19	1: male	no errors
yGi3Fb1qJk3o	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	5	10	In the first example the energy emitted by C is shared between all 4 entities, in the second example only one entity is using energy from C so I would assume more is available	46	2: female	NA
TtkE5mlnUm82	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_radial	5	5	It was never made clear if C was the only cause, there may be other causes (not called c), so like anything that can be on or off, and I really have insufficent evidence, I called it 50%	57	1: male	None
aqZReipIuTjz	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	8	9	As C  have unlimited energy send  influence, so  in A there 4 entities to take that radical influence from C.   In other, The C with unlimited energy send only one entity that is there. Possible it other way around merely on fact C itself have unlimited energy!	42	2: female	NA
m3crwIJHVXrg	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	10	10	It was stated that the cause influences with unlimited energy in all directions... so I think the presence of more effect entities would not lessen the strength of C	37	1: male	All good  thank you
3TAtC7T8YxGz	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	4	I thought that Sit A with four effect entities would have less strength of influence as it shared with other entities but in Sit B the one effect entity would receive more strength but would have a 50% chance of being off or on.	64	2: female	NA
49D5ferIE8e1	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	6	6	I gauged the amount of influence based on the thickness/magnitude of the channel line.  Since both appeared to be of equal thickness I assumed they were equivalent.  And since the source, C, has infinite energy with which to influence it didn't seem reasonable to assume that a single influenced entity would receive more energy than if it was one of four.	42	1: male	NA
ZEUA3JkZaqdR	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	5	6	i took the view that in situation b cause c influence would be greater than situation a as the single entity would mop up any residual influence. whereas in situation a all entities would be competing fo the influence	66	1: male	NA
si14tv1xaRjq	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	8	5	Due to C requiring energy to be sent to all entities at once, the energy to each entity in situation A would be less than to only one specific entity.	42	2: female	NA
Sx7FYJv4jBC6	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	3	7	I felt that as there was only one entity receiving influence on the right it was likely to have more concentrated influence from the main part, C. Whereas on the left hand side of the screen there were four possibilities receiving the influence so it would be more distributed across the four and therefore lower. 	40	2: female	NA
e1Aj2yIl2w6p	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	7	10	Situation b is 100% as it is a lone enitiy.	34	2: female	NA
OLiOfWUKFmrj	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	9	9	I think that the bottom right entity in the two different situations are influenced by the same straight of emissions since their is unlimited amount of energy cause C can transmit at every point in time.	34	1: male	NA
A3zTdrHCqlkD	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	5	6	I felt that if that entity was singularly present it had more ability to catch influence than the others, but when its 4 i get the sense of equality in that regard. There isn't too deep a thought as to why I chose what I did, it's just what my intuition told me	24	3: non-binary	NA
c3EJWLX0Pexl	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	3	8	I feel like the total energy would be split between the entities E.	51	2: female	NA
8Zcvxqymd9Ga	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	3	3	I imagined it like the sun emitting it's light (cause) and planets receiving that light (effect).  If the sun emits it's light in all directions, the amount of light received by a planet at a specific distance is going to be unaffected by the fact that there may be other planets at different positions also receiving the light.  So I stated that the effect was the same in both situations.	45	1: male	NA
SsVbEKYgmXnT	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	10	Because the amount of energy cause C has, which is infinite, there is no reason to believe that each Effect entity gets a finite amount of 1/4 of the energy. That amount could easily be the same as is channeled into entity E. They both could be very high, or they could be different. 	69	2: female	I did not notice any errors. This was really interesting!
bpHUu8lf05x0	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	0	10	Seemed to me if it was on only one would be showing	39	1: male	NA
bxY8NDh1Q7QX	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	2	3	The situation on the right was a bit higher since there was only one E, but both were on the lower side because of distance from C.	52	1: male	None
OnaAVodEVrfW	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	5	10	Assumption of equal energy distribution (entirety of cause entity's payload being distributed evenly amongst all active effect entities) made due to lack of information facilitating more specific judgments - no explicit indication of any 'limiter' regulating energy flow (e.g. each effect entity always receiving a certain amount of energy regardless of current configuration) or visual representation of varying activity levels.	27	1: male	n/a
QmFo1elj8qgD	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	3	8	Entity C gives out continuous amount of energy but is hitting three more E in the first scenario	42	2: female	NA
sXduTNudCvDs	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	7	10	if c is sending energy to one entity only the energy would be higher than if it was split.	33	1: male	NA
tTNk40Ng6GFG	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	7	10	Because energy is only being sent to one casual entity then I would expect it to receive a greater amount of energy. However, I was in two minds about this as I wondered whether the fact that C had unlimited energy would mean that it would make no difference. I went with my gut instinct.	60	1: male	No errors etc. Thanks
Cbs9WnhZyhpj	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	6	6	I gave them both the same probability as the fact that the number of entities present should not effect whether they are on or off	42	2: female	none
0lMBWH7yB9Gp	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_radial_limited	8	8	I am still unsure I am understanding of this but it seems to me that whether there are four or one,each will, although varying in activity, only be able to use so much energy at one time.	62	2: female	NA
klhf1LCh6Ila	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	"If the cause is on, then my understanding is that the state of the entities are not relative to one another - just to the cause.

Therefore, even if other entities are present, if the cause is 'on' the entity will be on."	31	1: male	NA
qnPpRbrrVnZi	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	10	Because C sends out unlimited amounts of energy and so the distribution should be high and even whatever the number of effect entities.	60	1: male	none
hMQxQos9YHOT	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	Since the energy radiating from C is infinite, it makes infinitesimal difference if some energy were to be absorbed by 4 versus 1 unit of E.	24	2: female	N/A, all went well.
CoyVYqI5bghr	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	my interpretation of the diagram was that the radial energy from effector C was causing all effected elements E to be ON in diagram A, and in diagram B the absent elements E were in the OFF state	41	1: male	NA
lOY7joGzMdsH	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	10	10	C has infinite energy and projects this energy out. Whether there are 1 or 4 effect entities, the strength of the energy projected would be the same. If there are 4 EE, each would receive as much energy as if there was one! 	48	2: female	N/A
I6gaSkisbqB6	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	In situation A there were four entities so I guess that approximately 25% of energy was going to each one. In situation B only one entity so activity would be high.	60	2: female	none
BNCYC2e35RZG	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	It seemed reasonable that A  would divide its energies between the 4 effect entities.  But in diagram B  there is only one effect entitie that is getting the energy.  So I felt that in diagram B it would have a higher rating 	51	2: female	I did not see any 
jX9asIz6qX38	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	1	2	Either way, the effect entities were on the outer edge of the circle, so I felt the effect on them would be low, as they were far away from the cause entity. But if there was only one effect entity (as opposed to four) I felt the effect would be a bit higher, as all of the cause entity's power was being transferred to that one effect.	35	2: female	N/A
8vzqNwsxPyOd	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	4	7	Because the one on the right only has one channel going into it. I intuitively thought that circle then had more energy going into it.	21	1: male	None, thank you. Everything went fine!
89FFFzwJdw2r	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	10	Assume that all energy flows through the channels, so if only one channel, the entity receives more energy than if the other three entities also receive a share.  Absent any other info, assumed this was the maximum.  	37	2: female	None
4F5f38S3nkM2	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	4	5	In the situation where all four effect entities were present, the energy sent out by the cause C would hit them equally due to the radial influence. In situation B, the energy is still being sent out in all directions and so the single effect entity would receive the same amount of energy.	37	2: female	NA
HqYgrFKOAzIL	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	5	10	I PRESUMED THAT THE FIRST ONE c EMITTED THE SAME FORCE TO ALL THE 4 CORNERS BUT IN THE SECOND ONE ONLY BOTTOM RIGHT WAS HIGHLIGHTED INDICATED TO ME MORE FORCE WAS USED BY C	56	2: female	NO ALL GOOD
6qy48zP0ngZk	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_radial	8	8	the bottom right entity was being effected in both examples, so in my opinion I think C has a strong influence over this one.	25	1: male	I didn't come across any errors
L47CnWNYUny6	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	there's no way for me to know for certain given that the energy the causal entity is emitting is infinite. I selected the middle as I felt like I didn't have enough knowledge to accurately predict what it could be in either situation. I didn't feel/intuit that it would necessarily be highly effected or effected in a limited way.	44	1: male	None.
xIdqj8ojYsTQ	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	5	5	"My understanding is that the Causal C sends out a specific amount of energy through each channel regardless of how many channels are open at one time. So the amount of energy for a specific entity is the same regardless of how many other entities there are.
"	25	1: male	NA
fRcHSQcpbZqw	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	7	7	I just felt the same energy would be given even though only one channel. C would just emit slightly less overall when just one channel and emit more when four. By the time more energy is split between four I felt it would more or less equal the one.	43	2: female	NA
cB4RBjlTkqE7	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	7	10	i marked them both differently, but now I should have marked them both the same. If C has infinite energy, then it doesnt mater how many e partciles there are, the same ones will exert the same effect entity	31	1: male	"no errors
"
FytJ89nMJRJS	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	6	7	I chose this because I felt that there was more contribution from the cause C to the other effect entities E in the case where there were 4. So the Cause C would give more of its specific energy amount to the other entities, so there would be less for the bottom right entity, compared to the case where there was only 1.	51	1: male	No issues!
Ij0OFKzOOJHh	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_radial_unlimited	6	2	NA	30	1: male	NA
EVQVvApJe9Xy	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	8	10	This may be a little overly simplistic however in scenario B, there was only one, where is in scenario and they were for and so it feels like the more the most energy would be coming from B	34	2: female	NA
Y16XhSaM9YLX	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_radial	6	5	When C is on and there are all four present, less energy will be distributed to each entity as opposed to when there is only one the bottom right entity present which will gain all of Cs energy as it doesnt have to be distributed	22	2: female	NA
sm4sPbTM7v8W	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	10	In the first case, the Cause, having finite amount of of energy to give, divides its energy between four Effects, but in the second case the only one Effect gets the foull amount of energy that can be given by the Cause.	35	1: male	NA
J5LNzMYQ2FEi	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	1	1	As the energy is emitted radially, it doesn't matter how many entities are present, only how close the entities in each scenario will change the activity.	45	1: male	None
j8zsd02eXZg8	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	3	9	I gave a stronger rating for the right hand situation because there was only one effect entity present and therefore it is likely that this was under a stronger influence that it may have been in the left hand situation.	27	1: male	No errors noticed
ZYSJ9ekyDFBJ	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	0	0	In both cases the bottom right entity was placed at the very edge of the radial field of influence, as its position was not changed, and the energy output of c was the same, the entity would receive the same amount of energy (the lowest possible).	28	1: male	Nothing to report
ZP0edaY0bUan	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	10	10	I understood that C gives has an unlimited amount of energy, and so if C has a causal effect on any and all Es, I presumed they would all be very high.	42	1: male	No errors, thanks.
EflqoVRqgK06	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	10	"i assume that:

- when there are four channels, each will receive about ~25% of the total energy, as the energy is evenly split between the four.

- when there is a single channel only, it receives 100% of the total energy."	34	1: male	n/a
LUPqhwzhcWmy	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	6	6	It will be intensified when the number of disemissions is reduced. 	40	1: male	No error
EOUmvUBwfohi	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	6	6	I think that the strength in both scenarios could have been higher if the entity had been closer to the cause. I think that because the entity in question in each scenario was the same distance away from C, then the strength of the influence is the same in both scenarios. Additionally, since C gives out energy radially, each entity only gets the influence that touches it in its' position, therefore additional entities do not affect the amount of influence that each entity receives, therefore the entities in each scenario receives the same strength of influence. 	25	2: female	NA
MDewMgsEaKwq	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_radial	2	10	I believe that the effect in BOTH situations A and B were definitely on because the cause was causing radical influence on the effects. The radical influence of the effects was on.	21	2: female	NA
bj71Rv7OT7yy	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	I got the impression the energy level of B would be higher as the casual node was only channeling to 1 effect node rather than 4, meaning it would be 4x as strong.	23	1: male	no errors
FlzqQzuTWM5n	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	5	5	the strength of effect on the bottom right entity is the same because the cause has infinite energy, thus adding more entities will not influence the effect on each one	23	1: male	NA
eOrgb24ch2RB	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	2	2	Both are at the same distance so i would expect to have the same force exerted on them	27	1: male	N/A
C1FCNgRyGv7V	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	5	5	The effect is radial and goes in all directions at once. The strength of the effect is the same in all directions regardless of whether or not other effects are present, so having only one effect entity present will not change how much it is being affected by Cause entity C. Since the strength of the cause entity's influence was not stated I cannot predict the strength of its effect of effect entity E in either case A or B. It could be strong, weak of somewhere in between, I selected the middle range as an average.	59	1: male	none
WOEk8Faoi3h0	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_channel_limited	8	8	All influences appear active and equal	67	2: female	NA
snGDtbjihvdu	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	8	10	If the cause entity has unlimited power then it could potentially be sending high strength to each of the 4 effect entities. Just because only one E is present it doesn't stand to reason that it is naturally taking all the power whilst the 4 E's are sharing and therefore receiving a lower level. The 4 could all draw full power from an unlimited power source	44	1: male	No errors
o3zEKRsCrFUO	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	Intuitively, I felt that the Effect entity was ON in both scenarios, as it reacts to the radial influence of the Cause entity, which was also ON.	42	1: male	None noted.
1TaRCtPO76HM	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	10	I believe the more effect entities that are present, the lower the strength of the effect on the effect on each specific effect entity. With only one effect entity, the strength of the effect is much higher	39	1: male	NA
kPP4GndMDFqO	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	6	9	I analyzed it based on the channels available. If the C has unlimited amount of energy it can process then with the same unlimited energy it may be greater through one channel than through 4 channels.	35	1: male	no errors were detected
nphsJ9cMbcNf	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	4	6	Have no idea really. Either could be on or off irrespective of how many effect entities there are..	36	1: male	NA
NZsG5jHxbed3	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	4	cont_radial_unlimited	3	2	because there was only 1 E	18	1: male	NA
wtWfdrySDfH8	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	10	10	Regardless of whether or not there are 4 or only 1 effect entities, bottom Right E will still get the same amount of energy from C because C emits the same energy radially, in all directions. So All 4 present will still get the same amount of radial energy regardless of whether or not the others are present. 	51	2: female	NA
hG1Odip8FAuG	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	8	8	"In a radial situation, the additional entities should have no effect on any given E entity as they cannot interfere with ""communication"" from the C"	46	2: female	NA
vUoPZbsybYz5	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	3	3	I think the strengths would be equal in situation A and B because the right effect entity is still in the same place i.e. the very edge of the radius and I don't think it makes a difference how many entities are present as C has an infinite amount of energy.	27	4: prefer not to say	N/A
5mdyNJjaslXi	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	9	if we assume all the energy is given by entity C via the channnels. Then having only 1 reicpient gives the reciepient maximum energy. Having 4 implies that the total energy is split 4 ways. However, these don't need to be equal divisions of energy nor was it stated than when C exerts channel infleunce it channels all energy to the recipient. So I gave almost max and not quite min ratings to situtation b and a respectively. 	25	2: female	NA
23hKac01GNMO	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	3	10	I marked the situation with 4 entities low as I thought to divide the energy from the C influence roughly by 4, so therefore I marked it approximatley a quarter of the dots on the scale. I gave the situation with the 1 entity the highest possible score as I felt that all the energy from C would be transfered and concentrated into the one single place.	58	1: male	I did not spot any errors and thought that it was structured really well. Very easy to understand also.Really enjoyed learning about the topics-very interesting thanks!
Z1MVbc566GL4	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	Because the entities can only be on or off, so if the causal entity is on and emitting radially, all entities in the radius should be affected	22	2: female	NA
wHb9wDuK6I0y	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	3	9	I believe that with only one effect entity the strength of energy from C will be more concentrated therefore higher than when there are 4 effect entities and the energy is shared between them all.	47	1: male	NA
cMcBgEmSP2f6	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	1	10	11 divide by 4 is 2 and change. Between needing to exert power verses take power if there are four taking power (maximum vs 1 which is minimum) I think there is less intensity from all of those taking the power so that each one is equal. In my mind 2 vs 3 is the best option for low intensity because so that each one receives or takes an equal amount of power. 	40	3: non-binary	None, thank you for having me.

Kj4eYYhpB3zD	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	I figured since C, the cause entity, was described to be providing infinite energy, that the number of E effect entities couldn't change the flux of energy being provided to each one. I do recall it saying that energy could change, but as there was no visual illustration of these entities having different energy levels at this time, I went with the answers of both in the middle, to say, the energy is being evenly distributed / the effect entities are taking on the same amount of energy, no matter how few or how many are within range of the cause entity. 	23	3: non-binary	n/a

This is because i assumed energy distribution to all four at once would be equal. In the case of situation B, i felt that energy distribution would be far more in favour in the bottom right entity at this time because the other 3 were not present.

LJqacQq1FXfU	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	2	10	"Because the cause C has a finite amount of energy that it can emit--and that energy is emitted radially--that means that there is a finite amount of activity that can be present for each effect entity present. Therefore, in the situation containing four effect entities, the energy available to influence each effect entity must be shared between the four effect entities, meaning that each effect entity will have lower levels of activity. Likewise, the situation were there is only one effect entity will have the full energy from cause C available to it to influence its level of activity, meaning the lone effect entity will have a higher level of activity.

And now, of course, I can see a different way of looking at the concept of radial influence: that this influence on effect entities differs solely on the distance between C and however many effect entities there may be. If this is true, then it wouldn't matter whether there was one or a million effect entities--they would all be influenced equally, as long as they were the same distance away from C."	63	1: male	I didn't see any problems or errors.

j677LX6oSfGT	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	5	5	As C emits energy equally in all directions, i do not think the presence of other entities would effect the energy emitted by other entities	38	2: female	No issues, but it definitely didn't take only 4 minutes to complete
PE88vlxr8m0O	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	8	8	I believe, following reading the fact that C has an unlimited amount of energy, that all E entities will receive the same amount of energy, regardless of its amount.	37	2: female	None
Mw69kSmwXzRb	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	4	8	I felt that with only one entity to influence the channel would be more intensely stronger and with the four entities they would each be weaker.	26	1: male	NA
z1C5HcXEHVC7	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	I didn't have any information as to what makes an Effect be on or off, so there's no way to tell either way so it's 50/50	34	2: female	NA
SrIRFU0YH9RE	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	8	With A if C was giving more influence to all 4 and it has a finite amount, it makes sense that it would give less to each one  than in B where it only has to give some to 1	62	2: female	none
TNntPcSdpAQq	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	6	8	As there was only one E in option B, it seemed like C would be able to focus more on it giving it more channelled energy. 	41	1: male	NA
m1q5WN3TOMZ0	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	5	I'm only considering the bottom right entity. As a result of what I learned from the about the system, they entities can either be on or off. So I put it at 50% which to me means that the entity is either on or off. 	29	1: male	Questions were clear and concise. Survey UI worked perfectly.
AqekJGbwnWA5	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_radial	9	9	I felt that Cause C influenced the bottom right effect entity in both these situations.	56	2: female	NA
5RKzR4FvFfoL	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	The effect entities are either on or off and have no relative strengths, therefore regardless of whether the cause influences just one or all four entities, they are all at 100%	21	2: female	n/a
w8bX5vc1wxnm	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	4	10	With only one entity present, my intution said that this entity is taking all the channel energy from the source, whereas when there are 4 entities, then it can only take a 1/4, even with an infinite source, i though infinite > 1/4*(infinite)	24	1: male	n/a
jmJZYnQrCDGg	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	6	8	I feel like the cause C would influence the bottom right effect entity in the same way across both instances, since the cause C emits would not fluctuate due to there being more or less effect entities. However instinctively, I felt that in example B that the effect entity would receive more due to it being the only one present to receive the influence.	32	1: male	NA
CJDSecbOFhu1	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	3	5	I pretty much just used the law of averages based on the fact that the channel can only be off or on.	40	1: male	No issues.
aX9QqSGJzFXw	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	binary_channel	9	8	I am pretty sure that they are both on.	28	1: male	The comprehension question about energy is not answered anywhere in the instructions.
FOwNscUdKcrA	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	Since we know the entities can only be on or off, I assumed there was an equal chance for each. Thus, there would be a 50% chance it is on and a 50% chance it is off regardless of the number of entities.	22	1: male	None
uv8ErwVseY7Q	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	4	8	I would assume that as the causal entity is providing energy to only one 'E' entity in Situation B, that the energy would be more concentrated and higher overall. However, on reflection thanks to this writing task I'm now considering that due to the unlimited nature of the causal entity, the energy amounts would likely be the same in both situations.	21	1: male	none to report
xQplre1QKVte	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	2	9	The entity has a certain amount of energy it can exert. If it is spreading it between multiple entities then I presumed that the amount going to each entity is less. When there is only one I assumed it was channeling the full amount of energy.	33	1: male	none
E1e8KhmMiCQj	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	6	6	Cause C is sending out the same amount of energy in both situations effecting the bottom right entity in the same way.	56	1: male	No errors.
vKvVA93Fy73X	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	6	8	Showing all four effect entities didn't imply too much one way or the other but it seemed to lean more towards all of them being affected. In situation two, we see a specific relationship between C and the effect entity. the fact that the other three entities are not presently shown implies to a greater degree that the remaining entity is being controlled.	56	1: male	none
LspazF7FLxGp	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	8	6	the locations of the entities were, in my opinion, having a direct correlation to the intensity of the effect.	39	1: male	NA

HXtUCpPpC4dL	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	8	8	I don't see there being any difference in the amount that each entity was effected as there is a clear path between C and E with no obstructions in the way.	36	1: male	Nothing that I can think of.
CLU9BtlUdA4x	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	binary_channel	10	10	Well both channels were present and I understand that the influence is either on or off and nothing in between so I chose 100% in both scenarios since they were both present.	39	2: female	No.
vF3ps78CEM8Y	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	8	8	I went with my intuition and imagined cause C giving off energy.	40	2: female	None.
ZLUEMkUXsmsn	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	2	10	Although the power channelled from C is variable without further information about the two example states it is more probably that when several effects are present the power will be shared and therefore I would assume that the state with only one effect channel would have more power.	39	1: male	It appeared to be ok.
e6VdGAFvoymp	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	5	10	It seemed as though it would be more intense if the same energy was applied to one vrs 4 of the entities.	41	1: male	I saw no errors.
TRQF9nivZjM7	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	10	10	If entity C has an unlimited amount of energy radiating out, then I believe at any point there will be an unlimited amount of energy.

f42M2gWNPOOf	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	3	2	I rated situation A slightly higher than situation B because there were more entities present in option A. My intuition suggested that neither of these options would be very strong due to the radial nature of the influence from C.	32	1: male	No errors
Www7RNh0rCWp	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	7	7	As the cause effect transmits energy radially, there was no reason to assume Situation B would result in more energy to the sole lower right Effect than it would in Situation A to the same lower right Effect. I perceived both to be equally far out from the cause and likely to have higher energy.	44	1: male	None noted
GAdNJaJAczy8	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	Because with four channels active it is emitting lower energy through each channel but with one active it is emitting energy at the highest level.	41	3: non-binary	NA

SJspy77voLD5	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	9	For the first system, the energy is being split between four effects, so the amount of energy will be about 1/4, meaning around average or perhaps a bit less than average. However in the second system, all energy is directed towards one effect, meaning the energy level will be quite high.	20	2: female	none
69ucj9qdjzJs	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	2	2	If C is radiating the same, limited amount of energy all Es will receive the same amount of energy regardless of how many are present.	34	2: female	N/A
jGVQyx4NkZJy	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	The study stated that the entity exists in two states either on or off, so if it's on it should cause an effect to the E dots. Regardless of whether it's one of the E dots that are on or all four, if C is on, then E should also turn on. The absence of the other 3 dots of E could be that they simply just aren't around at the present.	29	1: male	NA
UJG4vbf39mCb	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	I think that it wouldn't be displayed if the 'on' cause wasn't activating the 'on' effect.

mdxlN4IEeRGw	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	As mentioned, the entities are either on or off. Based on the two situations both show a channel present indicating that both entities are on and are effected by the cause C.	45	1: male	N/A
nUZEK6OPRtP5	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	5	5	It seems they would use the exact same amount of energy. If C has unlimited energy, there would be an equal amount channeled on both events.	34	2: female	None
WgDK9pdZQVwT	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	8	8	I just figured they may need to be on to be active and visible. Just felt like the right answer	36	2: female	no problems that i noticed
mSxKkG0EXrbN	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_radial_limited	9	9	guessed at the strength being 7 because all energy was being emitted at once but also, the effect entities are a little far away so might not get the full strength. strength would be the same in both situations as energy is being emitted radially so no matter what is present around it, the energy levels are equal at all points. So it doesnt matter how many effect entities are present, as long as they werent overlapping, they dont affect the amount of energy the others recieve.. i think	27	2: female	NA

W9L8jEiJfrNn	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	10	1	As all four effect entities are present in the first situation it would seem that the cause has a lot of strength but as only one entity is present in the second scenario and the other three are absent i believe the strength is much less.	32	2: female	NA
8srFf6obUDRf	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	10	I put very high for both because C has an unlimited amount of energy at all times, so the energy at E should be as high as possible no matter what the layout	41	2: female	NA

AJ8UXzc7cKYe	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	8	In situation B, only one effect was absorbing the rays of the Cause, so I could guess that B's single effect is a more intense reaction. I'm not sure if that takes into account limitless energy from the Cause though.	36	2: female	NA
ng8BqIIayOC4	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	10	10	I gave the highest rating since the causal entity C can emit unlimited energy independent of the amount of effect entities and on each situation the effect entities were furthest away from the cause. 	34	1: male	no issues, good luck with your research! 
7BIgpYQ465v0	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	You said it was on, so I figured it was equally like it was influencing both situations.	38	1: male	NA

URAT49rrwGUB	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	7	9	In fairness, as Cause C has an unlimited amount of energy, it is hard to predict how much strength is been channelled through both pictures. I would suspect that as there was only one E in picture B, the strength of the energy would be higher, however in reality I do not know this. I also suspect that the energy levels in picture A might be slightly lower as there were 4 E's compared to 1, however this is only a guess.	40	2: female	No

hP90VmaK1ovS	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_channel	3	10	Because A had all four present which I am not sure means they are all 100% on. If so, then I was totally wrong. B only had the bottom one present so I figured it would be 100% being the only one there.	36	1: male	N/A
a6ZdcNWGWaVN	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	10	It said the entity had a specific amount of energy to emit, so I figured that if there was only one channel to receive said energy, it would receive all of it and therefore have a higher level than if there were multiple channels.	27	2: female	NA
HKPtdknqaYtk	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	2	I felt that in B it was only affecting one thing, so it had a lower influence.

cfRuhkiQcdcw	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	4	9	I I rated the first one lower because it had four E's.

In the second diagram only one entity was receiving energy.  I feel that, with the present information, the second situation would result in a higher energy level because the energy is concentrated on one entity.  The first diagram suggest that the limited amount of energy that the cause (C) has is divied by four, resulting in less activity per channel.	44	2: female	I did not see any errors.

Xs7025iq8j9T	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	5	7	I believed that as there was only one channel in the second situation the energy level would be more intensive as only one effect entity was present and would not have to share the energy from C with anything else.	41	1: male	NA
zFnl8R5H9UcO	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	4	4	Given that only a certain amount of energy from C is possible and the radial influence remains unchanged in terms of direction, energy etc. I would thikn it would have the same effect on the bottom right E with or without the other E's.	40	2: female	NA
wkLQGLAvd64M	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	8	8	I felt like I had a lack of information. I didn't know whether the affect of C was dissipated by have extra Es attached or what the influence of C being turned on had. On balance I went with C affects E the same amount regardless of the number of Es and that C being on influenced E to be on but I didn't put 100% as I couldn't be sure.	32	2: female	NA
WjrIYHIULITk	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	3	I gave equal ratings because there were no changes in the way the visualizations were represented. In my eyes, the C is still emitting the same energy levels, I'm just being shown where they're going. Hence in A, all Es are getting the same amounts that the E within situation B would be getting alone.	27	1: male	NA
hurcoVAOlvAc	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	3	I equated the four effect entities all present as being the highest possible strength, which in turn would lead to when only bottom right entity was present as being approximately a quarter of that.	42	1: male	No issues to report back
x2rRGg7Kxecq	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	2	9	I gave these ratings because in B all of the energy was only going into one thing. Where as in A the energy was split between 4 things. 	52	2: female	NA

F8ZpeggMr9Kb	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	3	10	Because in A there are 4 entities so the bottom right entity would only get 25% of the effect, whereas it was the only entity in scenario B so it would get 100% of the effect 	38	2: female	NA
I1VFlaWP2jlL	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	5	10	If C can emit an unlimited amount of energy, I assumed if it was channelling that to four Es, each E would receive only 1/4 of the total energy.

VOtmLwcvGjeD	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	The situations described are entirely binary. Either the effect entity is there (and therefore can by impacted by the causal entity) or it is not. Either the causal entity is having a radial effect (and therefore is impacting the effect entities) or it is not. In both scenarios presented the referenced effect entity was present, and therefore was available to be impacted by the causal entity. In both scenarios presented the causal entity had radial lines surrounding it, implying that it is having a radial effect. Therefore in both cases the effect entity is being impacted by the causal entity.	42	2: female	no errors
t4nIXuTvvjCz	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	7	9	In situation B, cause C was only emitting energy to one channel, hence the probability that it was on was rated at 90%.

PJHXMxa1McU4	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	If the bottom right entity has two states, on or off, I think that there is a 50% chance that it is in either state no matter how many other entities there are.	30	2: female	NA
Ipm5ib2UU8yC	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	5	5	energy is shared by entities	66	2: female	NA
TreIeMsZjXAZ	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	It felt like there were only 2 possible options of on or off so I went in the middle, giving equal likelihood to both.  Having more E did not make any difference to the previous sentence.	43	1: male	N/A
ecsKkzqjSBc9	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	5	10	I feel that because there was only one other effect entities in the second diagram, it is probable that it will receive a high amount of energy as the other 3 were missing, therefore entity C had no where else to emit it's energy.	57	2: female	there were no errors
ZYCZlCD1oIbh	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	9	9	Because regardless of how much energy C is emitting, each entity can only absorb so much energy and it is independent of other entities. So regardless of how many other entities are present. If the bottom right entity is attracting energy from a cause in a radial influence, it will have the same amount of energy regardless of other entities present. In the diagram, the entity was absorbing the energy in the direct sphere of the cause, so would have lots of energy.	52	1: male	ALl good. Thank you.
eCe1ekyfaIgI	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	3	3	The circles were the same size in each and the same distance away from the cause, so I assume the energy emitted is comparable. In hindsight maybe B had more energy because more entities were present. 	30	1: male	NA
lkCB9jtLDg4a	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	3	3	Situation A all entities are the same distance away and C influences them the same amount. Therefore in situation B the bottom right is the only one present but still at the same distance as the previous Situation and subsequently the same level	24	1: male	None that I saw
X3KFSVH4tWbs	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	3	3	Only some of the energy it heading in that direction. 	41	2: female	NA
HGpaIKHLnoog	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	8	8	Cause C is radiating all of it's energy radially around itself, so the lower right effect entities will receive the same amount of energy regardless of how many other E entities are present. I chose three about the midpoint because each is being touched by three lines of energy, and that was good enough for me.	34	3: non-binary	none
TMuUrr6OMOde	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	10	I gave these ratings because the amount that cause C can emit is unlimited, therefore whether it was scenario A or B, I feel the amount would still be high 	28	2: female	NA
CGPhtj1msNbN	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	10	If C has unlimited energy and it was not specified that the channels have any limit themselves it is irrelevant how many Entities are connected, they could all potentially draw equally high amounts of energy.	43	1: male	No errors to report.
P7xZtXDsA4JK	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	9	5	I felt because C was sending energy via 4 channels it was busy and using a lot of energy. I felt because E was smaller it was using less energy.	42	1: male	NA
nLT3tcQMcodt	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	2	I think more energy was required for A as there were four entities present and therefore more energy would be required whereas B has only one and therefore less energy was required. 	30	2: female	NA
BGekIJc0dV3Z	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_unlimited	2	9	In situation A, the energy was shared between the 4 entities therefore the bottom right, got a smaller percent of the energy. In situation B, the bottom right was the only entity present, therefore it was getting all the energy.	34	2: female	none
pfuTFLhHL8wL	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	7	7	Because there is unlimited energy from C	32	2: female	NA
pdqr8PC3fSxQ	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	8	2	I gve this rating because i think it takes more power to keep the entity where it is when there is an even number of them (ie there was only one on the right) therefore it takes more power to keep it there. Whereas when there are four, it takes less power because they are even on all sides and there is equilibrium 	26	2: female	NA
5UlEzB2XnbKR	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	2	10	If C is effecting all 4 E at the same time, my intuition was to say each E was getting 25% of C's energy. If only one E is present, I theorised it would be getting 100% of C's energy.	30	1: male	NA
IGYtdzRpRX2p	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	6	10	In option B the entity was the sole recipient of energy which intuitively made me think of a more dense higher level of activity compared to option A where multiple entities were receiving energy.	27	2: female	NA
qPvamCLNE7s8	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	6	7	I know that the amount each C can emit is infinite but my core feeling was that if there was only one entity then this would be stronger. 	34	2: female	n/a
smREtDBz4Z7Y	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	6	6	"I think the same amount of influence was given in both situations, as there is only a specific amount.

uBMPiwWgfJqD	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	Because C has a finite level of energy, I just thought that focussing it all down on channel on E (as seen in B) would cause high levels of activity, whereas in A the energy is split between 4 channels it would have less impact on each E	33	2: female	N/A
QDjbhOGln7h6	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	8	2	if C is managing to affect 4 entities it must have quite a strong level of activity. whereas if it only affects one entity, perhaps the stength is less.	25	2: female	NA

owE4oxRp2jti	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	5	5	I have not been told anything about the energy levels in C, nor whether the resulting effects on E would be a proportion of C (for example, C/4), or whether they mimic C exactly. For this reason I choose the mid point as a best guess when no relevant information is available.	53	1: male	NA
1ozkKNeAKxUe	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	3	10	My rationale was quite basic, in that if there is only one outlet for the energy and there is a finite amount of energy, all of the energy would be distributed through that one channel, ergo 100%. In the case that there are 4 channels, I came to the conclusion that the total energy emitted would divide by 4, ergo 25% through each channel	42	1: male	No errors, thank you
AO3FBDiVLuSD	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	4	10	in the first scenario the energy is given across 4 effects whereas in the second scenario all the energy can go to one effect	45	2: female	NA
3pXKuqeOCbXO	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	if the cause C gave out unlimited energy in all directions then the bottom right effect entity would still get the same strength	43	1: male	NA
Z9oc7oEDsM9s	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	2	10	In A, there were 4 Es, so I thought 25%, but I could only select in 10% increments, so I chose 20%. In B, there was 1 E, so I chose 100%.	24	2: female	NA
FjMYPbKGWIPa	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	6	6	I gave those ratings because my intuition was that it was slightly more likely that the effect entities would be turned on by cause C rather than turned off. I believed this because the influence appears to be similar to energy, and energy typically turns things on rather than off.	28	1: male	None that I noticed.
hvXB1pHGTX8P	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_radial	5	5	If the causal effect  can only be off or on there could only be 2 outcomes for the effect entity?	34	2: female	NA
9NqfexHO3Zl2	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	4	10	As there was only one E I thought it must be on as it is the only one. With the other one as there was 4 there was less chance it would be on.	25	2: female	NA
Xxb1bepAuy81	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	3	8	In situation A I presumed any four of them could have been on and getting the radial fluency. In situation B it was the only one hence why i thought the percentage change was higher.	28	2: female	NA

IIqiz3RVsoCu	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	I felt that if C was on, then by exerting radial energy, it would turn all the Es on. I am not clear on whether the radial energy definitely affects them to turn the Es on or not. But I went with my gut in that it turns everything on.	32	2: female	couldn't see any
JHseVQsClDbW	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_radial_limited	9	1	there were more entities of e on illustration a so it was higher, whilst the second figure had less.	39	1: male	NA

For the second diagram, as only one effect entity was utilised, I assumed that there was a slightly smaller chance of whether it would be on or off.

I understand that this could be entirely incorrect as I do not feel intelligent enough to understand much content of the definitions given."	43	1: male	No everything worked fine. However I found it hard to understand many of the definitions and concepts presented. 
L1r8iQwpZEsA	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	5	I gave 50% probability for both because they have two states - on or off. I assumed the amount of effect entities that were present doesn't affect which state it's in.	32	2: female	NA

VxOzYaVMf0IE	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	5	I chose  this because they can only be in 2 states - on and off so the probability of this is 50/50 	53	1: male	No errors
HTVQsJWG3CeN	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	6	5	I thought situation A had more of a chance of the bottom right entity being on than situation B, because it had more effect entities.

sjkkLZjd8MM9	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	3	10	In A C was connected to four Es, so I felt one or more of the Es would be Off. In B, only one E is connected to C, so I assumed it would be On.	41	1: male	NA

MugpgVRARiX9	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	I wasn't really sure, but I guessed that if the influence went out radially it wouldn't be any stronger on the specific E whether there were 4 or 1 present	46	2: female	NA
mBy1QPGfd6nq	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	The radial influence is the same for individual effects disregarding the number of effects (at least that's the case for the current depictions).	30	1: male	NA
jC10BBBlhEYP	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	9	I assumed that with there only being one entity the cause would work better than whilst there were 4 separate entities	27	2: female	NA
4xcSShnRzTSM	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	7	5	In the scenario with more effect entities, the energy of C has to be more widely distributed.	18	1: male	NA

Kdjyini6jRcL	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	binary_channel	3	5	It could be on or off, it has to be one or the other, so I went with a gut feeling as to which one it could be but the chance could be 50% as it can't be anything inbetween.	26	2: female	None.
IeoaUwMK7ICo	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	They can only be on or off, right? So if the channel is open to that particular node, then it is on. At least that is what I can assume from the information I was given. Therefore, in both cases, that lower right node was on.	36	1: male	Seemed fine to me.
TKx8fovSb5Ry	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	I presumed that if the cause entity was on, then the effect entities would also be on.

ydkY8DVtguZx	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	In both cases the bottom right entity was present. I took that to mean that it was on. 	33	2: female	NA
Y7pKJb2rUF9N	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	For both of the previous ratings I gave 100%. As we were told that C can only be on or off, it therefore seems that my answer should have only been either 0 or 100%. Seeing as in both situation A and situation B the bottom right channels were present, I was 100% certain that the channels were on.	23	2: female	N/A

LqHe9LH2X5KK	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	7	7	Because the diagram is showing that there is an effect, and I feel like it’s more probable than not that there is a correlation. I felt like it was more than 50% likely so I estimated 75%	29	2: female	Not applicable 
S8Wb9vihlXOO	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	5	There are only 2 possibilities - on and off. I don't see how the number of Es affects anything. 	67	2: female	none
KtozbT06xOjl	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	Because the cause entities can only be on or off. The text on the previous page stated that they were on and so this cause entity is on. 	27	2: female	n/a
SUXbpMTFo6Jc	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	0	10	As per the instructions. C can channel to only one entity at a time.

jEBpSeOf6rSP	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_channel	10	10	Cause C influences the bottom right effect entity in situations a and b.

uGWZIJAG66Cu	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	If C is on then, all of the effects that it has cause over must be on as well.	28	1: male	NA
K1uV8Vvauzli	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	I said they were both on because that is what it stated about the two. Also they were connected, so that is why I said they were on. 	58	2: female	I saw no errors
t8qsmuW8eUed	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_channel	2	2	It's unlikely for only one effect to be on. However it is also unlikely that all four will be on at once. Thus they both got low probabilities. 	39	1: male	NA

dhsS0GXAXkqF	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	As the causal entities can only be on or off, any entity that C was axerting influence on via channel influence should also be on (irrespective of how many others are/aren't on).	47	1: male	All good
7IFaPb9xPtsD	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	8	6	"Well I know that C is on. There was never any mention of the effect entities would be on or not if C was on. So I mainly just guessed that there was a higher probability of it being on because of my understanding of how other things work in real life.

m42yP0YI3KMu	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_channel	10	10	It looks like power is going to both of the E's on the bottom right and under the instructions there is no energy in between, it is either on or off.	32	1: male	NA
5FVdLSwgn92x	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	The experiment says that all can only be on or off, nothing in between.

CBFT056jslTZ	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	9	The first diagram shows 4 effects, which are ''on''. With this in mind, I feel that the second diagram must be ''on'' too, because even though there are less effects being channeled, it is still being shown.

fjXqaigbagXH	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	You stated the effect from C was on therefore it was causing influence	62	1: male	Non that I noticed
uAfDfMUdmfac	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	5	5	If the cause influences radially then I understand it to be that the level of influence is the same at every point surrounding it and not influenced by the number of entities around it. I do not know how much influence is being radiated  so |I cannot say how much effect it has on the single entity in B so I have gone for the middle optoion 	54	1: male	I didn't notice any
bd1veRZJISuV	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	8	There was possibly more going in to B as there was less of the entity to spread across the 4 E's.	30	2: female	NA

R2DUR8sqyyhB	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	9	9	The cause entity has an unlimited amount of energy it sends out radially. I thought that the presence or absence of the other three effect entities wouldn't affect the bottom right entity.	23	1: male	NA

gtDFyPoWdlst	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	9	2	I really was just trying to give my best guess. It seemed like the most logical solution to me that if I saw more entities (E) that more energy was being emitted. If I saw multiple then it means multiple were being affected.	27	1: male	there were no errors that I saw
wL5afaXzaeSK	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	10	10	The other 3 effect entities by nature wouldn't influence each other, so them being there or not  doesnt effect the bottom right. The cause entity has a set level of energy, so when any of the effect entities are within its influence they are at a high or higher - I guess you have to take any variations of their own innate activity into account as well. 	41	1: male	no
JwS4XKNwai3u	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	4	8	My feeling was that the channel influence would be diluted somewhat in the first scenario rather than in the second where it would be more concentrated. 	37	2: female	none
M6DV4Omp01gu	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	2	10	The cause only has a specific amount of energy so it makes sense that the one with only one E would have more energy than the one with four Es	32	2: female	all went well
qvbTaFbVzxKo	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	The effect entity is either affected or not affected - there is no information about the cause mechanism and the effect response to conclude whether at any one time te effect is activated - so it's still only on or off.  Whether it is on or off is independent of how many other unique effect entitites there are.  If I had a chance t re-read I might suggest it's 25% (i.e. there's a 50% change the Causeis active and a 50 % chance the effect responds - so there are four combations I/I, I/O, O/I and O/O each with an equal probability = 25% n the absence of further information - but you asked for gut response and there's n opportunity to re-read to double-check my comprehension (there would be in real life!).	58	1: male	NA
vLHqK7UXtzFb	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	3	8	In example A as there were four entities I imagined that all of them would have a fairly similar level of activity.

XUAntdmRBNPD	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	5	10	I gave those ratings based on the number of 'E's. As there were four that would mean that the specific energy had to be spread out across more 'E's which means they hold less energy. 	21	1: male	NA

5RxuuQPHSnb3	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	3	10	In the first section C could send energy to all 4 entities so I decided that it would split energy among all 4 entities so a lowish energy for each entity. Whereas in the second situation C could send energy to just one entity so it could send a high amount of energy to it as its sole focus.	50	1: male	No issues at all
UZGDPC0WlBdu	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	Situation A had 4 entities whereas situation B only had one. Therefore, C would have to distribute its strength over more entities rather than putting it all towards one. 	20	2: female	None
MHAWV09LoTXK	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	2	10	In A the energy has to be split between 4 Es whereas in B it was all going to a single E	55	2: female	NA
j7FbkCKuddol	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	3	10	My intuition says that if the cause is split over 4 entities then it will be roughly 25% whereas if only channeled to 1 it will be full strength	49	2: female	None
vPuxGuNgiYgG	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	10	C has an unlimited amount of energy it can exert through the channels, so I believe each channel should be the same strength.

eGPDv291bEuK	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	10	3	In my opinion when I saw that only 1 entity was present, the strength would be less. When 4 entities were present, it felt as though a stronger force was at work.	31	1: male	None
TOy7CgB93qo0	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	4	8	It seems that the cause could have strong or weak influence on the effect in either scenario.

q2j8G2jHAEgS	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	3	7	Energy would be directed towards the single entity. Whereas I intuitively feel that when there are more than one entities that the energy would be divided by the number of entities involved. 	33	2: female	NA
Q6OhkKJpb8du	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	2	10	In B, all the energy was absorbed by the single entity E.

They was not  level to indicate 25% on the slider, therefore chose the nearest value.	57	2: female	NA
Xj0HUx11fYG8	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	7	7	I think the bottom right entity was highly influenced by the cause C. Not all the way up the scale as it was on the further out band circumference so it wasn't as close to the middle cause C which from the diagram kind of looks like the energy might be stronger closer to it. So because the bottom right entity was slightly further out I said it was highly influenced but not to the highest point. I also put both ratings as the same because I think the bottom right entity was influenced the same regardless of how many other entities were present. 	27	2: female	I didn't come across any errors during the study. Thank you 
Uju8cIv9cIol	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_channel_limited	3	7	Because in the B situation, C is only influencing one entity which might exert high energy and on the other hand in the A situation, C is affecting all four of them so the strength might be low.	30	1: male	None
dtEP6xLfIAEk	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	3	9	The cause entity in situation B, focuses directly on the bottom right and only entity within its radial sphere whereas, in situation A, there is additional dynamics involved and attention is diverted from the bottom right entity.	25	1: male	NA

c9InkTPxGDvd	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	1	1	I gave the two the same rating because both entities 'E' were in the same spot in both scenarios.

gnChGwl3bxGx	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	10	0	I must admit this is a very abstract scenario and it is somewhat hard to understand what is going on. If I have understood it correct, I assume if there is a force being exerted via channels, then when there is only one channel open to one entity that intensity is the highest. When all 4 channels are open, the force is distributed across all 4 (equally?) so this would be the state where any given force on 1 of the 4 entities would be least. 	38	1: male	NA
IgeNHkv2mt6J	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	10	For situation A I gave 50%, this was because I had information swaying me either way. I understand the causal system as being a bit of a lucky guess, so 50% seemed a pretty good guess of intuition. For B, I chose 100%, to me it seemed liked this was only channel for cause C to take?	22	2: female	I did not note any errors :)

2BhHHdcB0hp6	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	4	8	My thinking was that the energy coming from B was stronger because it pushed all the other entities away except for the bottom right one.

iEI3fI752z2o	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	There is a specific amount of energy, therefore with (A) the amount is shared so I assumed it is shared equally (11 dots so chose rating/dot 3).

0FpIun7IFmH9	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	8	8	I have given the specific rating.

BKmleKeIpVUS	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	The paragraph explained that the cause C was currently on. The left diagram had 4 E effects and the right, just one E.	48	2: female	None
OxOCHMnOderl	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	8	I feel that the strength had to be split 4 ways in situation A, whereas all the energy was focused on one entity in situation B, so it was emitting more energy	35	1: male	all was good :)
JXhnUxnA7TJz	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	6	9	A had 4 entities to effect so the energy of C was split between all 4.In B there was only 1 entity so it would have to take all the energy that C produced	55	1: male	no errors
9sC7VeaA2DA5	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	4	cont_channel_unlimited	7	7	Situation A showed 4 equal entities and the design of Situation B was the same but the only one entity.  The influence appeared to be the same	55	2: female	NA
cnvbNYfp71a2	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	welle the the radial influence is definitely as illustrated, and the entity can either be on or off so if there was no influence then nether effect would be affected. with regards to the strength i believe that that it wouldn't differ whether the other effects are on or off	32	2: female	i did not experience any technical issues with this study, thank you
Hd9nanyU7dw8	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	3	8	Because the cause has a finite amount of energy, the second diagram, where only one effect entity is present must have more energy, as it does not have to be spread across other entities (as seen in diagram 1)	25	3: non-binary	NA
LC1oLRIfRnid	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	3	10	Since the bottom-right entity (E) in Situation B is alone, it would not share energy from causal entity (C), and thus have higher activity. In situation A, bottom-right entity (E) shares energy from causal entity (C) with three other effect entities (E), and thus have lower activity.	30	1: male	none
z6fJYGGIvw0h	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_unlimited	10	10	I believe the same amount of energy given off by C is constant in all radius that it sends out. I believe in this case that equal amounts of energy will be sent to the entity regardless.	30	1: male	na
6gO3FzyjKIzM	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	I said there is a 50/50 chance that the bottom entities were on/off, because they don't really influence the cause, so even if they were on or off that wouldn't change the way the cause radically exerts its influence.	23	2: female	The program was easy to understand, I don't recall noticing any errors.
JCyt4RMm6Olp	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	7	7	Not full strength because it's a little distance from the cause entity. The same strength both times because the only thing that has changed is the lack of other entities in other directions. The lack of a receiving entity in other directions does not impact the amount the bottom-right entity can receive.	23	2: female	N/A
SRCBNC7BOcAZ	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	The bottom right entity was present in both scenarios so if something changed which got rid of the other 3 it didn't affect the bottom right so I picked 100% for that reason.	38	2: female	NA
VRFUcn2FaU1H	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	2	10	I gave these ratings because in A, there were 4 entities so there would be less energy going to each. Assuming C gave all equal energy. But in B, all the energy went to the one entity 	23	2: female	It was fine 
X0ICncu07AGl	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	9	I feel that in example A there is an equal influence on all E however it has a greater influence on E in example 2 as it is the only one	35	2: female	no errors 
2rR8iQBSNXKF	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	The scenario described the effect as 'on' and the intuition question was asking if the effect was on. So it seems clear to me that they should be rated as 100% certainty they they are activated.	33	1: male	NA
IlNhkramXcrG	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	The entity in the bottom right hand corner was visible in both situations. Because of that I felt that both entities were on.	24	2: female	NA

49tEzARmtCS8	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	7	7	because the cause C can only emit a specific amount of energy and it said that sometimes not all four entities are always there so i thought the strength would not change	20	2: female	none
AM3wC7bHelGn	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	1	1	Because the Cause C element emits its radial influence in all directions at once, I believed that the specific energy would be quite low at the point where the Effect was. As it's being emitted radially I thought the energy level would be the same in both cases, even though there was a different number of Effect elements. 	51	1: male	None that I was aware of.
kOAPY7rM5Av4	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	10	In section A it could out of 4 entities so it could be a 25% chance. In section B there was only one entity so it would suggest this was 100% on.	26	2: female	NA

QI7xl9D8LzFV	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	As to the actual ratings there was nothing to base it off of, but something that I could decide is how much the bottom right entities differ between the two examples, and in my opinion they would not differ at all. Since the energy dispersed from the source is radial, having less entities around would not mean that the one that is left could receive any more energy, as there would still be the exact same amount headed it's direction.	21	1: male	NA
NyNMNigYlZCP	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_channel_unlimited	7	10	as picture b only showed one entity, it would be realistic to assume that all the energy would be transferred here making it high. where as picture a, needs to be separated between 4 entities and would therefore be lower.	31	2: female	none
vbBs0kgJnB6Q	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	10	10	The instructions said that there was unlimited energy from the cause so levels would be high annd sufficient regardless of how many entities	66	2: female	no errors

KV90Gm7yJ0L8	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_radial	10	10	Because it can either be on or off which means that even though it was on and only ommiting one energy, it was still on	25	2: female	NA
3zfLQGCT5ypA	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	7	7	My assumption is that the cause C is sending out an influence that decreases over distance resulting in a less than 100% chance that effect E will be on. The number of effects E does not change this likelihood because the cause C is a radial emmiter, making each point on the circle have the same level of influence (only decreasing as it moves away from the cause C).	39	1: male	NA

euXTEmTOfV21	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	2	8	My assumption was the cause would split out it’s energy between the four effects in scenario A making it likely the intensity level of one was low, where as with there being only one effect, all the energy emitted by the cause would be going through just that one effect, making it more likely to be high intensity.	21	1: male	None
I3my5VZp89Px	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	4	10	in the first scenario there were all 4 effect entities, which implies that energy was being distributed to all of them. however in the second scenario there is only one effect entity taking all the energy from the cause entity.	21	2: female	none

5cd1d4PJvPRU	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	5	10	Looking back, I should have selected the same strength for both as the highest, as the force the cause entity emits is infinite, meaning each effect entity receives an infinite amount of influence regardless of how many others there are. However, during the study, I figured that due to the force being spread across all 4 entities in A, I assumed it would have less force applied individually when compared to the effect entity in B.	20	1: male	NA

BaGPBEkh7zkQ	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	6	9	My thinking was that when there are four entities present, then the C entity will probably share the amount of energy equally (I accept that there is unlimited energy but this does not mean it uses unlimited energy).  Where there is only one entity E present, then the C entity will divert more resources to it, but not necessarily 4 times as much. Hence I chose a higher activity in the second scenario compared to the first.  On the other hand, I did also wonder about the thickness of the channel lines, which I could also interpret at the amount of energy being transferred.  If that is case then it could be argued that the amount of energy is the same.	38	1: male	No problems at all.

HpJZSCnXeUat	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	2	9	I believe the entity to have higher energy when all entity/effect channels are present. When only one is present, I believe to have a lower energy.	29	2: female	NA
mtiQZsUtGzGA	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	In situation A, C was spending its energy on 4 E's. In situation B, it was using its energy on one channel.	41	1: male	NA
uwqsb8TqNcme	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	7	7	Since its impossible to know how much energy is being sent out by C I just guessed based on distance and location.	35	2: female	NA
2coQtb4SS3Q2	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	cont_channel_unlimited	6	6	because the other three are not active i guess that the one that is active, is receiving a higher effect from 'c'. 	49	2: female	not applicable
fxuIA8lJwaiC	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	3	binary_radial	10	10	There is no indication in a finite amount of energy, so it shouldn't matter if it is shared or not.	22	2: female	NA
3HPAGYoklqLq	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_channel_limited	1	10	In the first one the energy distributed to each entity is along all four channels NS THEREFORE ONLY ONE QUARTER PER e.  iN THE SECOND SITUATION ALL THE NERGY IS TRANSFERRED ALONG ONE CHANNEL TO ONE ENTITY.	50	2: female	NA

B1IrrrHUssvI	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	5	5	C appears to be emmiting the same amount of energy in both instances and because the energy is emmited radially it would not matter how many effect entities are present, the bottom right entity in both situations would be affected in the same way.	48	1: male	NA

I just assume that when C is sending energy to just one system that energy will be very high rather than it spread through the other 3"	37	1: male	"
I could see no problems at all in the study it was well laid out and intersting to do and I hope my answers help with your research"
Z1pjkzndOCi4	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	3	3	I gave these ratings with the belief that c radiated energy and direction to e 	40	2: female	NA
hMkx1YPhJgMD	3	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_unlimited	7	10	I rated the scenario B as very high since there was only one E entity to be influenced by unlimited amount of energy and it seem to me that the influence would be more active than in scenario A, where the influence was distributed and there was a chance of various levels of activity.	32	2: female	None.
DyfOJhTMWbNj	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	3	10	"C was emitting maximum energy and therefore would effect one E entity to the maximum amount. With four E entities in the diagram I would expect to see a reduction in the amount of energy transfered to each E entity from C. So that meant working out a method to divide the energy emitted by C between the E entities. As there wre four entities I divided by four to give around a 3-4 on the scale,

Having explained how I did this I now realise that my answer may be completely wrong. This is because the radial energy from C would still be exerting maximum force no matter how many E entities there were, and that the absorbtion of energy from C by one E may not affect the energy transferred to any of the others. If all of the Es were lined up so that C's energy had to pass through a line of Es then that may have an affect on all of the Es, but thinking about it again, if the Es are seperate and diverse then Cs energy may have 100% force on all four Es."	62	1: male	No errors to report. All went smoothly and the study was interesting and educational.
xvZYIMmoWPpj	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	10	10	"If this cause C has an unlimited amount of energy, it doesn't matter if there is 4 effect entities or 1 effect entity, because it is capable of producing an unlimited amount of energy. It's not ""giving some"" to one effect entity and ""less"" to another entity - especially since it's ""radial"". It will always be giving an infinite amount of energy everywhere, and so it will always be high for every effect entity, regardless of the amount of entities."	38	1: male	NA
EsKdKmU9P4IB	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	10	Since all four entities were present in situation A there was an equal chance for either one of the four entities to be present whereas in situation B we only see one entity present thus we see that there is a 100% possibility of the bottom right corner entity being activated.	30	1: male	NA
FpeZ8S5HIL6K	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	9	In situation A, C is influencing 4 effects so the influence would be weaker for all 4.  In situation B only e is being influenced by C so the effect is stronger.	54	2: female	NA
Y7wyXjKJJ4SP	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	C was affecting E in both situations regardless of how many other entities there may or may not have been in each scenario.  They can only be on or off and as C was channeling to E in both images they are both ON	37	2: female	no

lewVK5x3Khgc	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	10	10	It was indicated that the entity was on since it effects E radically this entity was impacted in both scenerios	31	1: male	NA
JlaTuvMRePvG	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	2	2	Based on my intuition, the effect entities are decently far out from the cause entity, at least in the depiction given. Taken literally, I would assume the energy dissipates as the radial sizes increase, and this is the same thing that happens whether there is four effect entities or just one. So, I rated it somewhat low.	24	1: male	No errors, thank you for letting me participate.
1MPdegCIpFDG	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	7	10	Less energy in A because all four are present compared to the second one only having one entity present	28	1: male	NA
izjJjBjcGjCt	1	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_unlimited	10	1	I believed that in the first diagram A, the effect entities were emitting very high energy/effect whereas in diagram B it appeared it was emitting or having a very low effect. 	57	2: female	none
QLjzfnj7ZOqg	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	4	6	I simply think that the absorbed energy for the situation including four effect entities would be lower than the absorbed energy when only one effect entity is present.  I do understand that the cause C only has a set amount of energy that can be generated.	57	1: male	no issues
T5IUK5kw8vst	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	8	8	it wasn't clear to me whether the Clause had equal affects on all all 4 or just 1 element, and whether the radial elements had to follow the clause state or just 'may' follow it	73	1: male	none
9DDJ32mo48id	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	binary_channel	8	9	As there was only 1 entity present in B I assumed it had more presence and was on. Whilst A all were present so it was less of a possibility that it was in an on state.	50	1: male	NA
nJ26kXb2soqG	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_radial_limited	3	9	I just assumed that due to their only being only entity to absorp said influence it would absorb more of the specific ammount of energy outputted by c	28	1: male	it seemed fine and intuitive
CPuUtopuwAZN	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	"It primarily had to do with the statement that an entity could only ever be on or off and there was no in between state. Given this information and the channel influence shown it didn't matter if there was 1 or 4 entities connected to the causal entity, any connection to the causal object would indicate to me that the other objects were ""on""."	35	1: male	None that I could perceive. 
Af2bsVMeov8J	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	5	5	Mostly because they can only be on or off, that is why I picked 50% for both questions. It doesn't matter how many E's are around the C, because of the way you explained this study	51	2: female	none
51CoyVCi2opR	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	6	6	C only has a certain amount of energy it emits, so the energy would be the same whether there are 4 Es or 1 E.	60	2: female	NA
0fz9Iz4xBmJF	4	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	cont_channel_limited	2	10	I assumed that because the causal entity has a specific amount of energy that it emits, it would split that energy emission between four effect entities at a much lower level than if it emitted the energy to just one effect entity. 	40	1: male	No, everything worked well for me.
rmV4af2nNcDx	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	It appeared that the entity was on as there was a line linking it to the other entities. It seemed like the most logical explanation.	32	2: female	I could not notice any particular errors in that way.
DzELEK6DctiJ	5	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_radial	8	8	I have the ratings because the effect entities were present, however I was not 100% sure.	25	1: male	NA
Hk1Sljg7ycnE	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	7	10	because there are more effect entities in A. then there is less c influence energy and has to be shared out between 4 but in B. there is only 1 E entity and more energy can be used to influence the E.	27	2: female	none
1UCp0w6yJJsL	2	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	2	cont_radial_limited	6	8	With four effects the intensity is spread, whereas the single E would be more intense.	21	1: male	n/a

iknEOFW11bvq	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	If both effect entities are connected to the cause influence, that made me believe that both must have been on and have a strong strength	26	2: female	NA
RsyZatehuGOp	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	The effect entities are either on or off. If they are off they do not appear on the schematic. Therefore I was 100% certain with my answer.	58	1: male	NA

PnyrUqjLVNl5	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	The text stated that C was on and the channel of influence leading to E was visible in both diagrams.	38	1: male	NA
MOS9GtkHLsSb	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	8	8	A was linked up to all four E's so I thought that would be on and B was linked up to one E so i thought that must have been on as well as if it was off there would be no E's	29	2: female	NA
Dl17k6ddJ7Hh	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	9	9	Using my intuition I felt like it was always quite likely that the bottom left was going to be on with loooking at the diagrams	31	2: female	NA

1pRmMspOcpvT	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	I thought about C as a light switch and the 4 Es as light bulbs. So in my imagination, when C was on, whichever light bulb(s) were connected to it were on, regardless.	40	2: female	None.It was clear.
Dlbo8enAuw3j	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	10	10	The information noted that C was on, this suggested to me that it was likely that E was also on in both scenarios. 	37	2: female	NA
23cPim4DxOko	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	5	I gave a rating of 50% probability in both cases as the entities can either be on or off.  I don't think it matters how many there are at one time, the probability is the same either way.	32	2: female	none
9XfrgfTAGyS5	6	1: I confirm	1: I will take it seriously	1	binary_channel	5	5	If the cause entity can either be off or on then there is a fifty percent chance that it will be on at any time for any of the channels. This will be true whether there are 4 channels or one	56	2: female	NA
