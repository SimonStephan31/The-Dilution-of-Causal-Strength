95	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	29	100	1	1	C1 had the possibility of causing 3 possible outcomes, and E1 was just one of them. C2 has less alternate possibilities.	26	2	-99	136
111	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	64	66	1	1	Because it could be a specific function used. For expel C1 could start off as 3 outputs and C2 could mean 3 minus it’s 2 leaving 1 output	18	2	-99	337
116	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	26	97	1	1	As x1 had effects of three other thing where as c2 had effects only on E1	18	2	-99	98
134	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	45	97	1	1	C1 can lead to 3 outcomes,  and may only lead to one or two of them. C2 always causes outcomes E1	50	1	-99	96
141	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	50	39	1	1	C1 caused an effect to 3 different things which made me feel it was a big situation whereas C2 only cased an effect to one thing which made me feel it wasn't as big.	34	2	-99	285
173	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	46	95	1	1	C1 influenced 3 spheres and C2 influenced 1. I think that the direct interation is stronger.	46	1	no.	191
177	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	76	99	1	1	c1 has less effect as there are 3 effects  c2 only has one effect	46	2	-99	181
189	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	66	98	1	1	because C2 has only one  direct line linked	22	2	n/a	376
208	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	99	100	1	1	If it points toward an effect that means it did something to trigger the effect so it should be maximum	25	1	n/a	100
218	multiple_left	multiple_first	first	50	61	1	1	I can see that cause one effects more things that cause 2	34	2	-99	81
101	single_left	multiple_first	first	25	95	1	1	I gave a strongly effect rating for C1 and E1 because C1 only branches out to E1and nothing else. C2 branches out to three: E1, E2, and E3. I document that C2 will only affect E1 1/3 of the time.	18	2	Everything went well!	213
118	single_left	multiple_first	first	54	98	1	1	Not sure if direct effect, seen in a straight line middle to middle means it's a stronger effect, or the same as the ones coming off the  side  of the circle.	38	2	-99	155
130	single_left	multiple_first	first	42	100	1	1	C1 only has got E1, where as C2 has 3 to deal with meaning its not as strong as C1	41	1	-99	157
138	single_left	multiple_first	first	77	100	1	1	C1 very strongly on E1 because there is only one influencing factor . C2 fairly strongly on E1 as there are 2 other  influencing factors E2 and E3.	37	2	-99	483
154	single_left	multiple_first	first	74	100	1	1	since C1 is only affecting E1,the effect will be stronger than that of C2, since C2 is connected to 3 relations	31	1	-99	164
176	single_left	multiple_first	first	49	100	1	1	C1 has a direct effect on E1  C2 has an effect on E1, E2 and E3	41	1	-99	151
185	single_left	multiple_first	first	35	99	1	1	C1 only affected one outcome, and therefore was very strongly causally linked to E1; however C2 affected 3 outcomes and, by intuition I decided that C2 shared it's causal strength between equally E1, E2 and E3 resulting in a strength 1/3 of that of C1.	21	1	-99	274
188	single_left	multiple_first	first	47	100	1	1	C1 has less number of  subject to influence therefore will have more strengths and influence to effect.  C2 has 3 subject to influence therefore will have weak strength over to influence them.	37	1	n/a	546
207	single_left	multiple_first	first	50	100	1	1	The reason being C1 has a more direct influence on the factor than c2 does. C2 has an influence on a wide variety of factors.	34	2	There were no errors	202
211	single_left	multiple_first	first	33	100	1	1	C1 alone with E1 has a very strong effect because all of C1's strength is focused on E1 but with C2, its strength is shared among E1,2 and 3 so the effect is not so much as C1's influence.	30	1	No, the grammar was correct in its entirety.	484
89	multiple_left	single_first	first	56	69	1	1	For the first question, it has the extra support of the two by its side. For the second, it only has support from one side	22	2	-99	114
103	multiple_left	single_first	first	42	19	1	1	C2 ONLY AFFECTED E1 AND C1 AFFECTED E1 E2 AND E3 SO I CONCLUDED THAT C1 HAS THE STRONGER EFFECT	42	2	-99	220
119	multiple_left	single_first	first	75	99	1	1	Because there was no other choice but for C2 to lead to E1, it had a very high strength of influence.     Because C1 could have led to 2 other possibilities, there was a low strength of influence between C1 and E1.	21	2	-99	169
132	multiple_left	single_first	first	77	52	1	1	C2 was the strength to E2 and more so C1 is the matter strength to E1	36	1	-99	377
149	multiple_left	single_first	first	67	100	1	1	because c 2 can only influence one, c 1 still has a strong influence but is spread between others	42	2	-99	150
152	multiple_left	single_first	first	32	99	1	1	C2 had a direct link, whereas the link C1 had was shared between three other parties	47	1	-99	217
162	multiple_left	single_first	first	28	99	1	1	C2 had influence over 1 factor whereas C1 had over 3 factors. C2 could use all strength into one but C1 had to influence 3	48	2	I did not notice any	471
183	multiple_left	single_first	first	44	99	1	1	the second symbol only had 1 other option where as the first symbol had 3 options	27	2	no	75
194	multiple_left	single_first	first	69	100	1	1	For C2 as it only has one possible effect I would assume that the cause would always have a strong impact on the effect. However for C1 as there are 3 possible effects I felt like the impact was slightly weaker as it's split between 3.	29	2	n/a	478
209	multiple_left	single_first	first	28	55	1	1	C1 would give a weaker effect compared to C2 because it is less specific and is causally related to E1, E2, and E3.	19	2	-99	125
90	single_left	single_first	first	100	100	1	1	There was not enough information provided to acurately guage the strength.	39	1	-99	172
110	single_left	single_first	first	99	100	1	1	C1 causally influences one and C2 causally influences three.	26	2	-99	169
115	single_left	single_first	first	27	99	1	1	C1 can only have an impact on Effect 1, there were no other options  C2 could impact 3 different Effects	37	2	-99	117
127	single_left	single_first	first	32	98	1	1	The first scenario showed 1:1 and the second was 1:3. In my mind having one cause directly influence on an effect it feels it would have stronger influence, versus the cause influencing 3 separate things.	35	2	-99	307
139	single_left	single_first	first	100	100	1	1	The diagrams show a direct, one way cause, with no causes between them. Additionally, even though C2 causes other causes, that does not mean it does not cause each of the other causes just as strongly as C1 does.	60	1	-99	473
158	single_left	single_first	first	0	100	1	1	Because c2 influences 3 types. While c1 influences 1 type.	22	2	None	169
172	single_left	single_first	first	27	87	1	1	Because C1 is only effecting E1 and C2 is having an effect on more than one thing, I assumed that C1 must be having a stronger effect on E1 than C2 is.	22	2	-99	187
186	single_left	single_first	first	67	92	1	1	In the first diagram, all of C1's strength was focused on E1. In the second diagram, C2's strength was split in 3, which would mean E1 would only get a 3rd of C2's strength.	32	2	-99	291
187	single_left	single_first	first	100	100	1	1	Both  C  factors have the ability to influence the occurrence of E1. Have no data that would allow me to conclude that they influence it differently between them	40	1	all good	205
206	single_left	single_first	first	25	100	1	1	I would presume that if a cause produced only one effect, than that effect is caused directly and solely by the influencing cause. If C1 will always produce only E1, then that implies that this effect is happening regardless of other influences that might be around C1. However, if C2 can influence three different things, that implies that outside variables are a factor, and that therefore C2 + this other factor decides whether we reach E1, E2, or E3. Therefore, C2 is not as strong an influence as C1.	30	3	No errors	293
97	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	33	100	1	1	Its because using mathematical concepts, c1 branches out to three different e's. e1,e2,e3. I divided the scale by 3 to get that answer. c2 gives it all to e2 so that is why that was 100.	19	1	-99	130
102	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	53	100	1	1	C1 effected 3 elements whereas c2 only directly effected one. Therefore my answers were roughly a third for the first one to represent the 3 and 100% for c2 which only directly effected one	33	2	-99	174
117	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	49	99	1	1	I said C1 influences E2 moderately, because its effect was shared with two other effects as well. On the other hand, C2 only influenced E2, so it has a strong causal influence.	22	2	-99	122
133	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	54	40	1	1	i dont know	38	2	-99	111
145	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	29	100	1	1	Because C1 influences three factors whilst C2 just the one	33	1	-99	98
157	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	58	58	1	1	The diagrams clearly show that C1 and C2 both have an effect on E2 which is why I moved my sliders to the right (more towards very strongly) however from the diagram alone I can't be certain exactly how much of an effect they are having on E2 only than there is an effect - which is why I didn't want to chose very strongly. While it's tempting to assume that because C1 affects multiple factors then the effects must be less strong and because there is only 1 link between C2 and E2 the effect must be stronger this may not be the case. The effects may be completely independent of one another which is why I tried to place the sliders at the same points for both causes.	29	3	No problems with the study noted.	482
167	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	84	86	1	1	I chose my answers because each letter and number that were mentioned were connected.	19	2	-99	179
179	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	39	99	1	1	C1 is influenced by 3 things, C2 has a 1:1 relationship	28	1	-99	75
205	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	73	99	1	1	It was just a direct line so the force is stronger where as the other diagram had three circles	58	2	-99	122
212	multiple_left	multiple_first	second	73	100	1	1	For me, one-to-one interaction is much stronger than too many interactions. Hence when I saw C1 being distributed to additional 2 nodes I immediately thought more effort.	30	1	-99	420
93	single_left	multiple_first	second	41	100	1	1	I felt that C1 was stronger due to it only being related to one other cause and C2 had a 1/3 relationship with the other two causes	53	2	-99	186
109	single_left	multiple_first	second	30	100	1	1	C1 directly causes E1, not the case with C2	24	2	no	109
125	single_left	multiple_first	second	66	78	1	1	For C1 - I am assuming that there are no other factors that would influence the effect E1.  In other words, E1 is only influenced/caused by C1.  I am not sure if this assumption is valid and hence the score I used.    For C2, I am assuming that if C2 can have effect E2/E3/E4, its strength on each individual E2 would be weaker.  Again, I am not sure if this assumption is valid and hence the score I used.	57	2	None	186
131	single_left	multiple_first	second	51	81	1	1	C1 would have more impact and all the time but not ALL of the impact while C2 can only have impact 1/3 of the time	25	1	-99	117
146	single_left	multiple_first	second	32	31	1	1	with out knowing the property's of each iteam, it is difficult to determining the rates of strenght	39	1	-99	204
163	single_left	multiple_first	second	83	53	1	1	in the second diagram, the effect was split between 3 different factors which minimized the strength whereas in the first one it was concentrated on one thing	21	2	-99	160
171	single_left	multiple_first	second	41	53	1	1	Honestly? The question was a bit hard for me to answer and I do not have an explanation on why I gave these ratings.	19	2	There were no problems at all. I really enjoyed taking part :)	146
181	single_left	multiple_first	second	88	36	1	1	I would assume that something that affects only one thing (C1 affecting E2), would have a stronger effect than that which influences 3 things at the same time due to it being more concentrated.	23	3	-99	201
200	single_left	multiple_first	second	100	100	1	1	They are directly linked forward rather than up or down even though e1 and e3 have equal direction.  This is because I have been taught top read left to right not left-up or left-down.	43	3	-99	203
203	single_left	multiple_first	second	50	50	1	1	For C1, it seemed like it had a direct cause to E2. For C2, however, I disregarded the other two causes and focused primarily on C2 effecting E2 because the former was in the middle section and it lined up with C1.	25	2	Had trouble using the bar.	311
99	multiple_left	single_first	second	25	100	1	1	Because C2 is only influencing E2, and on the other han C1 causes E2 and two more effects.	18	2	-99	287
114	multiple_left	single_first	second	64	100	1	1	The C2 diagram only had one outcome, so it very causally provoked its singular response. The C1 diagram had 3 outcomes, so there seems to be a 1/3 chance that the E2 would be chosen.	19	2	-99	119
124	multiple_left	single_first	second	70	84	1	1	Since C² has a direct effect on E² I think it has a more powerful effect than C¹ and since C¹ has to share it among three if it's kind	35	1	The study was glitch free thanks	228
136	multiple_left	single_first	second	99	12	1	1	Just because the one is strongly/directly affected does not mean that they are ALL strongly affected.	32	2	-99	248
144	multiple_left	single_first	second	27	99	1	1	1:1 is the strongest influence     1:3 there are others able to influence other decisions	24	2	-99	190
165	multiple_left	single_first	second	35	99	1	1	I thought maybe since C1 had many effects, it wasn't as strong (likely) but C2 all of the cause went to this effect, making it stronger, more likely.	26	2	-99	142
169	multiple_left	single_first	second	31	100	1	1	C2 uses all it's power to produce E2.    C1 divides it's strength by 3	38	2	-99	121
198	multiple_left	single_first	second	47	42	1	1	Since c1 has the ability to effect 3 at the same time I made the assumption that c1 is more stronger than c2 therefore due to its strength, the impact is big. This is why I chose c1 to have a bigger effect than c2.	19	2	-99	210
204	multiple_left	single_first	second	33	100	1	1	Because C2 is only influencing E2, it seems like it's more direct and therefore a stronger influence.  Since C1 is influencing several different outcomes, I assumed the influence wasn't quite as strong.	27	2	-99	205
215	multiple_left	single_first	second	100	100	1	1	I rated both as extremely high because there was a direct link between C1 and its causal variable, as well as between C2 and its causal variable. A variable can affect multiple different variables with the same level of intensity depending on what the variable is.	21	2	nothing!	275
92	single_left	single_first	second	99	99	1	1	C1 and C2 are the same that they are the only influencers.  But c1 is only influencing one outcome, C2 is influencing 3.	28	2	-99	162
123	single_left	single_first	second	64	68	1	1	The diagram cited earleir depict	35	1	none	199
128	single_left	single_first	second	37	99	1	1	C1 doesn't have to influence any other cause, whereas C2 has to influence more than one. C1 will have more time to influence than C2.	33	2	On the very first page (the introduction?), the word  understanding  is misspelled. I also believe  labeled  is misspelled. No other errors.	267
148	single_left	single_first	second	34	100	1	1	mathmatical analysis of this. The first diagram had 100% effect and the second one had 33.33%	31	1	none	78
153	single_left	single_first	second	33	86	1	1	As C1 only has a casual effect on one other I put it as strongly but C2 effects 3 others so I decided to move the curses a third of the way along.	41	1	-99	233
170	single_left	single_first	second	31	100	1	1	c1 gives all to e2  while c2 gives 1 third to e2	38	1	-99	139
184	single_left	single_first	second	31	100	1	1	C2 affects three nodes whereas C1 has a direct relationship with only one - therefore the strength of C1 to E1 will be much greater than a shared strength among three nodes.	47	1	-99	119
193	single_left	single_first	second	64	99	1	1	C1 is only causing one effect whereas C2 is causing three therefore C1 is more strongly affecting the effect than C2	42	2	-99	159
201	single_left	single_first	second	64	100	1	1	I believe that C1 affects E2 strongly because they have a direct link and also E2 is the only one that is being affected by C1. While on the other hand, C2's affects are divided between E1, E2 and E3.	26	2	-99	370
222	single_left	single_first	second	99	99	1	1	Both of them are related strongly. Even though C2 effects more E's, it still has the same individual effect on each one.	20	2	-99	314
100	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	27	99	1	1	c 1 was effecting 3 things so it made sense to make its influence around about a third of the one which was only effecting one thing	38	1	-99	177
107	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	40	86	1	1	There was only 1 bond between C2 and E3. Generally speaking 1 bond is stronger than multiple.. Think about having multiple friends, it's much harder to maintain 3 deep friendships than 1	21	1	-99	117
122	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	62	100	1	1	The first diagram linked off into three different sections, I thought each section took one third whereas the second diagram linked directly to the next section	31	2	-99	143
137	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	91	90	1	1	both have a strong effect, i see no difference in the strength of the affectedness	24	2	none	79
151	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	53	96	1	1	C1 has 3 causes of influence to deal with whereas c2 only has one influence to deal with so more focus will be on that.	45	2	no errors	217
161	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	54	30	1	1	i just went by how long the line was,as i thought the long the line the greater the influence.	32	2	-99	259
190	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	28	100	1	1	for C1 it has 3 directions meaning a third for each where as with C2 its 100% causes the effect with nothing else happening.	35	1	-99	376
191	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	14	88	1	1	I feel that C1 does not directly impact C2 so it has a weak influence. C3 directly impacts E3 so there is a very strong relationship because there is only one relationship connecting them.	18	2	-99	150
199	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	99	99	1	1	I thought C1 and C2 had the same direct relationship with E3. The other causes in C1 had no direct effect with E3.	46	1	-99	464
219	multiple_left	multiple_first	third	37	44	1	1	To be honest i dont really know	59	2	none	134
104	single_left	multiple_first	third	51	38	1	1	thats what i thought on first impression due to the pull of c1	32	2	-99	49
112	single_left	multiple_first	third	65	88	1	1	C1 had only one link to E3 so in my mind i thought that this meant it was stronger. A single concentrated connection.	26	2	-99	141
121	single_left	multiple_first	third	100	100	1	1	I gave these rating because both C1 and C2 directly effect E3. There was no middle man between them or anything, there was a direct link between both C1 and C2 to E3. So the effect strength seems strong.	27	1	none	119
126	single_left	multiple_first	third	100	31	1	1	In the first diagram, C1 could only act upon one thing. The 'thing' has all of C1s effect.  In the secong pic C2 acted on three things. The effect was split into 3	52	1	-99	209
140	single_left	multiple_first	third	100	100	1	1	Because the influence either exists or it doesn't. There was nothing in the instructions to indicate how strong the influence is - just that there was one. I saw it as being binary. Either on or off which means there is no measure of strength	44	2	none	249
156	single_left	multiple_first	third	46	100	1	1	Since C1 only influences one other entity, I believe the influence would be quite strong. C2, however, influences three other entities so I believe there would be less chance of strong influence.	59	2	None.	240
174	single_left	multiple_first	third	100	100	1	1	I gave these ratings because you could clearly see on the diagram which cause was connected to another.	31	1	-99	162
195	single_left	multiple_first	third	17	95	1	1	C2 could only influence E3 weakly because it is influencing 2 other factors at a goal. That is, the influence is shared between 3 factors. On the other hand, C1 is only influencing just a factor which is E3, therefore, the force is very strong.	36	1	-99	459
202	single_left	multiple_first	third	92	92	1	1	Both demonstrate a direct effect, with no other causes affecting the result, The fact C2 also affects other results is not relevant	35	1	-99	156

108	multiple_left	single_first	third	34	83	1	1	C1 could lead to three different causal effects, while C2 only lead to one.	51	1	-99	275
120	multiple_left	single_first	third	91	100	1	1	It might not make sense, but because C2 only caused one reaction (E3), I intuitively felt that the relationship was stronger. Because C1 caused three reactions, it 'felt like' those might be individually less strongly corrolated.	38	2	none	155
129	multiple_left	single_first	third	31	72	1	1	C2 is only affecting E3 only, so I would assume that it would affect it very strongly. While compared to C1 which is affecting three Es, which seems equally. I would assume that the effect on E3 would be weak because E2 and E1 are also affected.	21	2	-99	415
142	multiple_left	single_first	third	31	100	1	1	C2's only effect was E3 while C1 had multiple effects	20	1	-99	97
155	multiple_left	single_first	third	33	100	1	1	The second one is very strongly because it is the only cause influencing that outcome. On the first example there are two other causes so the influence is spread three ways.	35	1	-99	143
166	multiple_left	single_first	third	98	98	1	1	I gave both C1 and C2 the same rating as, given the info provided in the graphic, i cannot be sure of any other factors influencing E3 therefore, they will have the same strength of effect.	22	2	-99	332
175	multiple_left	single_first	third	89	46	1	1	I feel like the longer the arrow, the more strong the influence would be.	18	2	-99	291
196	multiple_left	single_first	third	44	100	1	1	c2 was straight ahead e3, and there were less effects(E) on C2. C1 had more effects(E) so it had to share with the other effects.	19	1	no errors. everything went well.	753
213	multiple_left	single_first	third	33	99	1	1	In C2 it can only have one outcome so the it has a higher effect. In C1 there are three options of outcomes so the strength of the effect is lowered to 1/3.	27	2	-99	180
96	single_left	single_first	third	94	93	1	1	C1 and C2 both cause effects similarly in strength even though C2 causes multiple effects.	54	1	-99	218
105	single_left	single_first	third	66	92	1	1	I marked the relationship in the second image as weaker because there are 3 different bubbles that C2 has to be split up into, as opposed to the first image with C1.	29	2	-99	115
113	single_left	single_first	third	41	98	1	1	As C1 only directly influenced E3 and no other strands I would take that to mean that it strongly influenced as there were no other strands to dilute. In the second picture, it was split 3 ways so I would expect that influence to be less.	46	2	-99	175
135	single_left	single_first	third	33	100	1	1	c1 to e1 is a 1 to 1 relationship therefore it has a stronger effect whereas in the second diagram the relationship is 1 to 3 therefore, the severity of the effect is divided into 3.	19	1	-99	150
147	single_left	single_first	third	31	100	1	1	I thought that C1 would have a very large effect on E3 because it was the only casual link.   I thought that C2 would have a much smaller effect on E3 because it was also linked to 2 other effects.	18	2	no errors	247
150	single_left	single_first	third	44	42	1	1	I gave roughly equal ratings as I believe there is the good chance that c1 and c2 had the same effect. There is no particular reason, simply intuition.	31	1	-99	329
180	single_left	single_first	third	100	100	1	1	The only force active on the E's is the C's so they are in relative terms acting strongly because there is nothing else to compare the E's to.	30	1	-99	147
197	single_left	single_first	third	100	100	1	1	Because they both have E3 rating	24	2	none	87
210	single_left	single_first	third	99	100	1	1	I gave both C1 and C2 a strong influence because they were the sole influencers in both given examples. Although C2 was influencing 3 effects, it was the sole influencer. I don't believe the strength of C1 and C2's influence would be different even though each example had a different numbers of effects.	26	2	I did not experience any issues with this survey and it worked well on my browser (Mozilla Firefox).	216
221	single_left	single_first	third	34	100	1	1	There is no enough information for my assumption but I assumed the level of C1 and C2 to be the same. In that sense, C1 is just strongly causimng one effect E1. On the other hand, the influence of C2 is distributed across three effects E1,E2,E3. My second assumption is that, these effects are on the same level and the influence  of C2 is just one-third on each of them.	32	1	no	520
