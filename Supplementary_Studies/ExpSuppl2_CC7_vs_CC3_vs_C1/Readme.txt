In this study, we tested two common causes (one with 7 and one with 3 effects) and a single effect cause. 

The ".txt" file contains the data. The columns are: 

"sID": 				subject ID 
"Crystal_Order":		Counterbalancing factor: the order in which the three causes were displayed (from left to right); 1_3_7 means, e.g., single-effect cause left, 3-effects common cause middle, 7-effects common cause right.
"Q_Order":			Counterbalancing factor: the order in which the strength queries were asked
"Multiple_Effects":		Counterbalancing factor coding whether the multiple-effects common cause was red or blue
"1_strength_rating":		DV (subjects' ratings for the single-effect cause)
"3_strength_rating":		DV (subjects' ratings for the 3-effects common cause)
"7_strength_rating":		DV (subjects' ratings for the 7-effects common cause)
"Desktop_Confirmation":		Check query (subjects had to indicate that they work on a Desktop PC [1]) 
"Attention_Confirmation":	Chech query (subjectes had to indicate that they will pay attention [1])
"Age":				Subjects' age in years
"Sex":				Subjects' sex (1 = male, 2 = female, 3 = non-binary)
"Technical_issues":		Open query (subjects could report any experienced technical issues)
"Duration (sek)":		The time subjects needed to complete the study (in seconds)
